                            <br/> The Google Map version 3 plugin for jQuery and jQM takes away some of the head aches from working with the Google Map API. Instead of having to use Google event listeners for simple events like click, you can use jQuery click events on the map and markers.

                            <br/> RequireJS loads plain JavaScript files as well as more defined modules. It is optimized for in-browser use, including in a Web Worker, but it can be used in other JavaScript environments, like Rhino and Node. It implements the Asynchronous Module API.
                            <br/>RequireJS uses plain script tags to load modules/files, so it should allow for easy debugging. It can be used simply to load existing JavaScript files, so you can add it to your existing project without having to re-write your JavaScript files.
                            <br/>RequireJS includes an optimization tool you can run as part of your packaging steps for deploying your code. The optimization tool can combine and minify your JavaScript files to allow for better performance.
                            <br/>If the JavaScript file defines a JavaScript module via define(), then there are other benefits RequireJS can offer: improvements over traditional CommonJS modules and loading multiple versions of a module in a page. RequireJS also has a plugin system that supports features like i18n string bundles, and text file dependencies.
                            <br/>RequireJS does not have any dependencies on a JavaScript framework.
                            <br/>RequireJS works in IE 6+, Firefox 2+, Safari 3.2+, Chrome 3+, and Opera 10+.
